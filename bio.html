		<title>Ranjit Thomas Biography</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<p>My name is Ranjit Thomas and I come from all over the United States.  I was born in Detroit, Michigan.  At the tender age of four, I moved to a town right outside New Orleans.  Several years later, we moved to the real Midwest, more specifically, Fargo, North Dakota.  My parents would later move the family to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where I lived through my pre-teen years.  Finally, we moved to a suburb of Boston where we would live for the rest of my childhood.</p>
		<p>I came into college intending to be a chemistry major who would pursue the pre-med track.  However after taking an intro to cs class my sophomore summer, I realized I would instead like to take on a computer science degree (with a minor in mathematics).</p>
